# Introduction

**KIN welcomes all contributions**. We're building a product that will hopefully make the world a fairer place,
as such we could not build it without the efforts of many people,
so please don't be shy and share your help with us. Even the tiniest contribution can make a difference!

These guidelines briefly explain how to contribute in an effective manner, making sure to keep high
quality standards and making it easier for your contributions to make through.

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or [blog posts](https://medium.com/kinblog), improving the [documentation](https://partners.kinecosystem.com), asking and answering questions on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kin), submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code.

Kin has many public [Github repositories](https://github.com/kinecosystem) for an arrary of products. Before openning an issue, please make sure you are in the right reposity. 

If you have any product questions please join [our community on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/KinFoundation/).

Note that we have a code of conduct, which we ask you follow in all your interactions with the project.

## Getting Started

1. Do the changes in your fork

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@kinecosystem.com instead.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:
1. What's your current environment? i.e. operating system, processor architecture, node version
1. What did you do?
1. What did you expect to see?

## Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a bi-weekly triage meeting. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
