### Requesting Payment for a Custom Earn Offer ###

A custom Earn offer allows your users to earn Kin as a reward for performing tasks you want to incentivize, such as setting a profile picture or rating your app. (Custom offers are created by your app, as opposed to offers created by other platforms such as the Kin Ecosystem Server.)

>**NOTE:** For now, custom Earn offers must be displayed and managed by your app, and cannot be added to the Kin Marketplace (unlike custom Spend offers).

Once the user has completed the task associated with the Earn offer, you request Kin payment for the user.

*To request payment for a user who has completed an Earn offer:*

1.	Create a JWT that represents an Earn offer signed by you, using the header and payload templates below. (See [Generating the JWT Token](../README.md#generating-the-jwt-token) for more details about JWT structure).

**JWT header:**
```
{
    "alg": "ES256", // Hash function
    "typ": "JWT",
    "kid": string" // identifier of the keypair that was used to sign the JWT. identifiers and public keys will be provided by signer authority. This enables using multiple private/public key pairs (a list of public keys and their ids need to be provided by signer authority to verifier in advanced)
}
```

**JWT payload:**
```
{
    // common/ standard fields
    iat: number; // issued at - seconds from Epoch
    iss: string; // issuer
    exp: number; // expiration
    sub: "earn"

   // application fields
   offer: {
           id: string; // offer id is decided by you (internal)
           amount: number; // amount of kin for this offer - price
   }
   recipient: {
          user_id: string; // user_id who will perform the order
          title: string; // order title - appears in order history
          description: string; // order desc. (in order history)
   }
}
```
2.	Call `Kin.requestPayment` (see code example below). The Ecosystem Server credits the user account (assuming the appâ€™s account has sufficient funds).

>**NOTES:**
>* The following snippet is taken from the SDK Sample App, in which the JWT is created and signed by the Android client side for presentation purposes only. Do not use this method in production! In production, the JWT must be signed by the server, with a secure private key.
> * See [BlockchainException](COMMON_ERRORS.md#blockchainException--Represents-an-error-originated-with-kin-blockchain-error-code-might-be) and [ServiceException](COMMON_ERRORS.md#serviceexception---represents-an-error-communicating-with-kin-server-error-code-might-be) for possible errors.

```java
try {
    Kin.requestPayment(offerJwt, new KinCallback<OrderConfirmation>() {
        @Override
        public void onResponse(OrderConfirmation orderConfirmation) {
            // OrderConfirmation will be called once Ecosystem payment transaction to user completed successfully.
            // OrderConfirmation can be kept on digital service side as a receipt proving user received his Kin.
            System.out.println("Succeed to create native earn.\n jwtConfirmation: " + orderConfirmation.getJwtConfirmation());
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(KinEcosystemException exception) {
            System.out.println("Failed - " + exception.getMessage());
        }
    });
}
catch (ClientException exception) {
    exception.printStackTrace();
}
```
